# OpenAI Integration Setup

This application now uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model to generate intelligent architecture recommendations based on your project requirements.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get an OpenAI API Key

1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Sign in or create an account
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy the generated API key

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project:

```bash
# OpenAI API Configuration
REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

**Important:** 
- Replace `your_actual_api_key_here` with your real OpenAI API key
- The environment variable must start with `REACT_APP_` for Create React App to recognize it

### 3. Restart the Development Server

After adding the environment variable, restart your development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: Users describe their project, select industry, and specify expected user volume
2. **AI Analysis**: The system sends this information to OpenAI's GPT-4 model
3. **Intelligent Recommendations**: GPT-4 analyzes the requirements and generates:
   - Architecture patterns (microservices, monolith, event-driven)
   - Technology stack recommendations
   - Database and caching strategies
   - Security and compliance requirements
   - Performance targets
   - Testing strategies
   - Cost estimates and timelines

## Features

- **Industry-Specific Recommendations**: Tailored advice based on healthcare, financial, manufacturing, etc.
- **Compliance Awareness**: Automatic inclusion of relevant compliance frameworks (HIPAA, SOX, GDPR, etc.)
- **Scalability Considerations**: Recommendations based on expected user volume
- **Security Focus**: Enterprise-grade security recommendations
- **Cost Estimation**: AI-generated cost and timeline estimates

## Error Handling

If the OpenAI API is unavailable or returns an error, the system will fall back to default enterprise-grade recommendations to ensure the application continues to work.

## Cost Considerations

- Each recommendation request uses approximately 1000-2000 tokens
- Current pricing: ~$0.03-0.06 per request
- Consider implementing rate limiting for production use

## Security Notes

- Never commit your API key to version control
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Consider implementing API key rotation for production environments
